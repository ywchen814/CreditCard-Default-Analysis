# CreditCard-Default-Analysis
## Introduction
Welcome to our project on predicting credit card default using machine learning techniques. In this analysis, we have explored a dataset related to credit card default and applied various machine learning models to understand the factors contributing to default and improve prediction accuracy.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are at a higher risk of **defaulting** on their credit card payments. By leveraging **machine learning algorithms** and advanced modeling techniques, we aim to provide financial institutions with valuable insights to better manage **credit risk** and tailor their strategies accordingly.

## Methodology
We employed a range of modeling techniques, including **regression**, **clustering**, and **machine learning**, to achieve our goals. Regression models such as **logistic regression** and **LASSO regression** helped us understand the relationship between input variables and the likelihood of loan default. Clustering algorithms like **K-means** and **hierarchical clustering** allowed us to group customers with similar characteristics, enabling better segmentation and targeted strategies. Machine learning models such as **decision trees**, **random forests**, and **neural networks** provided deeper insights into complex relationships and patterns within the dataset.

## Key Findings
Through our analysis, we made several key findings:
- The variables representing payment status in recent months carry more weight in determining default probabilities, suggesting that a person's current payment behavior is a better indicator of their likelihood to default than their past payment history.
- We identified significant predictors of loan default, which can help financial institutions prioritize risk assessment and develop proactive measures to mitigate default risks.
- Our clustering analysis revealed distinct customer segments based on their credit card usage patterns, allowing for more personalized strategies and targeted interventions.

## Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing the credit card default dataset, we have gained valuable insights into predicting loan default and identifying significant predictors. This project aims to assist financial institutions in making informed decisions to manage credit risk effectively and reduce default rates.
